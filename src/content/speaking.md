I've had the pleasure of sharing my experience and passions in a variety of formats, from conferences to podcasts to webinars. As you'll notice, I love to talk about accessibility and higher education, if you ever want to chat. I'm active in the WordPress community so most of my speaking engagements are for WordPress-related events or publications. I post [my presentation slides](https://www.slideshare.net/rachelcarden) on SlideShare.

## Webinars

Webinars take advantage of technology and allow anyone to teach, or share what they're working on, over the Internet, without the expense and (sometimes) hassle of travel.

## WordCamps

[WordCamps](https://central.wordcamp.org/) are community-organized conferences that focus on WordPress. They are (usually) city-based. These informal events allow myself, and other WordPress users, the opportunity to share what we're doing with WordPress, learn from others, and visit with dear friends. Sometimes I apply to speak, sometimes I simply go to attend and enjoy the camaraderie and professional development. Some of my talks are posted on WordPress.tv. They are listed under [Rachel Cherry](https://wordpress.tv/speakers/rachel-cherry/) and [Rachel Carden](https://wordpress.tv/speakers/rachel-carden/).

## Meetups

I've shared at a few meetups over the years but these are generally not shared or available online. I'll try to document what I can find.

* I [discussed accessibility](https://womenwhowp.org/rachel-carden-shares-a11y-guidelines-with-women-who-wp/) with the Women who WP meetup in November 2016.

_* If I've failed to mention something, it was not intentional. I'd really appreciate the heads up so I can add it to the list._
