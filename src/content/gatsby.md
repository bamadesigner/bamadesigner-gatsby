[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a free and open source framework based on React. I have become a big fan of their community, their leadership, and the priority they place on accessibility.

## Gatsby Google Group
If you'd like to discuss, share, support other devs, and learn all things Gatsby: you are welcome to join our [Gatsby Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/bamadesigner.com/forum/#!forum/gatsby). I look forward to learning with you!

### 100 Days of Gatsby Challenge
Our group is participating in the #100DaysofGatsby challenge starting January 1, 2020.

### Code of Conduct
If need be, I will put together a Code of Conduct but until then: be kind, considerate, constructive, and respectful and we won't have a problem. However, I reserve the right to remove anyone I feel is harmful to the group, its goals, and its members.
