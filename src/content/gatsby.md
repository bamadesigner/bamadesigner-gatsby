[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a free and open source framework based on React. I have become a big fan of their community, their leadership, and the priority they place on accessibility.

This website is built using Gatsby.

## Gatsby Group Community
I created (and moderate) a [Gatsby Groups.io forum](https://groups.io/g/gatsby) where web developers discuss, share, support each other, and learn all things Gatsby. You are welcome to join! I look forward to learning with you.

*Initially, this group was hosted as a Google Group. We migrated to Groups.io on January 26, 2020 to have more features, options, and customization.*
