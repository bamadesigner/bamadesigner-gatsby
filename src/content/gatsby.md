[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a free and open source framework based on React. I have become a big fan of their community, their leadership, and the priority they place on accessibility.

## Gatsby Google Group
I created (and moderate) a Google Group forum where web developers discuss, share, support each other, and learn all things Gatsby. You are welcome to join! I look forward to learning with you.

### 100 Days of Gatsby Challenge
Our Google Group is participating in the #100DaysofGatsby challenge starting January 1, 2020.

You can find the challenges on the Gatsby blog using their ["100DaysOfGatsby" blog tag](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/100-day-of-gatsby).

### Code of Conduct
If need be, I will put together a Code of Conduct but until then: be kind, considerate, constructive, and respectful and we won't have a problem. However, I reserve the right to remove anyone I feel is harmful to the group, its goals, and its members.
