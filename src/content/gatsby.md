[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a free and open source framework based on React. I have become a big fan of their community, their leadership, and the priority they place on accessibility.

## Gatsby Google Group
I created (and moderate) a Google Group forum where web developers discuss, share, support each other, and learn all things Gatsby. You are welcome to join! I look forward to learning with you.

### 100 Days of Gatsby Challenge
Our Google Group is participating in the "100 Days of Gatsby" challenge starting January 1, 2020.

### Our group mission
A place for all members to discuss, share, support each other, and learn all things Gatsby.

### Why a Google Group?
As someone who has many Slack accounts, I'm intrigued to experiment with Google Groups as a method of group communication in which you do not have to follow along in real time to participate. **You can read and respond in your own time!**

### How to get the most out of the group:
If you've never participated in a Google Group before, it's basically a listserv. **It's an email powered web forum.** For the complete list, [view our "Welcome" thread](https://groups.google.com/a/bamadesigner.com/d/msg/gatsby/z6pKsH0I6ko/TXi0X8c6BAAJ).

* You can follow along by email.
* You can [view all posts in the forum](https://groups.google.com/a/bamadesigner.com/forum/#!forum/gatsby).
* While I won't require any specific level of activity (we all have busy lives), I do ask that you participate when possible and refrain from only "lurking". **We all want to learn and hear from you!**

### Before you post to the group:

For more detailed instructions, [view our "Welcome" thread](https://groups.google.com/a/bamadesigner.com/d/msg/gatsby/z6pKsH0I6ko/TXi0X8c6BAAJ).

* **Look at previous forum posts** to see if your topic is already being discussed.
* Be sure to include a **concise** subject and message
* Did you search the web first for answers? e.g. Google or DuckDuckGo
* **Be mindful of using gender specific language** like “guys” as our group has more than just members of the male gender.
* Keep in mind that most online communication lacks nuance, like nonverbal cues, facial expressions, and body language.
* While we all struggle and become frustrated from time to time, this will **not be a place to vent or criticize.**

### Code of Conduct
If need be, I will put together a Code of Conduct but until then: be kind, considerate, constructive, and respectful and we won't have a problem. However, I reserve the right to remove anyone I feel is harmful to the group, its goals, and its members.

### To report inappropriate behavior
If you've been the victim of, or witness to, inappropriate behavior, please forward the information to [gatsby+owners@bamadesigner.com](mailto:gatsby+owners@bamadesigner.com).
