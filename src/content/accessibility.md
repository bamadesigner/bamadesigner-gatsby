I love to discuss, educate, and advocate for online accessibility.

Iâ€™m working on more content, and possibly some educational materials, so be sure to subscribe to my mailing list for updates.

## Accessibility resources
In the meantime, check out this extensive list of [accessibility resources](https://www.wpcampus.org/learning/accessibility/) curated by the WPCampus community.

## Gutenberg accessibility audit
I also encourage you to read the [results of the accessibility audit for Gutenberg, WordPress's block editor](https://www.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/05/gutenberg-audit-results/). The audit was commissioned by [WPCampus](https://www.wpcampus.org/). It is a free and lengthy resource filled with vast knowledge on how to create accessible websites.
