Gravity Forms includes its rendered form markup in the wp-json REST API. It also goes so far to modify the action URL to point to the REST API. However, it also includes jQuery code so its not a viable solution on a 3rd party site that doesn't use jQuery.

This did make me realize I could use this code to display a form on another site on my WordPress multisite network instead of using an <iframe>.
